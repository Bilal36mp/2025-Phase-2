# Part 2 - Weather Data Analysis

This assignment involves exploring a real-world weather dataset to understand the relationships between different weather variables and to **predict the maximum daily temperature** using the relevant feature(s).

## Files

- `part2_submission.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook to be completed.
- `Summary of Weather.csv` — The weather dataset for analysis, it contains information on weather conditions recorded on each day at various weather stations around the world. Information includes precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed and whether the day included thunder storms or other poor weather conditions.

## Objectives

- Explore and analyze the relationship between weather variables.
- Train and evaluate a model to predicts `MaxTemp`

## What You Need to Do

In the notebook:

- Complete all **code cells**.
- Answer all **Short Answer** questions.
- Analyze the results of your model and comment on its performance.

## Submission
